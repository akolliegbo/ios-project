## Instructions:

* Initial brainstorming ideas \- 6 minimum	  
  * Evaluation of top 3 ideas  
  * Final app idea chosen  
* Creation of GitHub Project Repo  
* Creation of README with:   
  * App name \+ App Description  
  * App Overview: Description and evaluation  
  * App Spec: User features, screens & navigation flows  
* Wireframe images  
  * Hand draw screens, flow of navigation  
  * Rough draft of how the app will look

## Step 1: Generate new ideas

* Favorite Existing Apps:  
  * Pinterest  
  * Instagram  
  * Airbnb  
  * Spotify  
  * Duolingo  
  * Tinder  
* Volunteer Near Me \- allows map and location function for users to determine the closest volunteer activities that are happening in their area with the ability to sign up for the events  
* Recycle Me \- allows user to take a picture of the item they would like to throw away but is not sure what material it is (i.e. compost, recycle, trash). Helps identify the material to throw away  
* Explain To Me \- AI will provide a simplified explanation to the topic the user is inquiring. Can also translate foreign language barriers (i.e. complicated words, slang) to provide more context to the user  
* Make up \- takes the prices from different stores, shows which one has best deal (or ect depending on filters like location, price, deals)  
* Health tracker  \- incorporating cycle syncing w workouts meals and whatnot  
* Vacation planner \- share vacation itinerary with other ppl, local safety stats, food and time blocks for each day,   
  * perchance ai recommendations of things to do  
  * Incorporate maps, AI, location, realtime  
* Elevated notes app \- kinda like notion but more intuitive and maybe diff color schemes   
* Task with game-like rewards \- maybe there's like a cute anime girl that jumps when you complete a task, the tasks you complete gives you points, you can use that to upgrade the anime girl (clothes, hair color, ect)  
  * Send reminders (you didnt do this task\! Its been 4 hours\!)  
  * AI voice   
  * Store voice notes  
* Romance story game \- you know those storyboard games that like switch frame to frame, you select options and the pictures that vibrate  
* Mystic messenger rip-off \- chat with AI bots that act like a boyfriend/boy (space) friend/love interest  
* Make stickers \- like the sticker feature in iphone, but for this you can upload images, draw on them, change the cropping, stretch, ect  
* Quiz but interview prep \- quizzes but interview/job related questions, you can add your own questions and answers Maybe ai resume review

Step 2: Evaluating App Ideas

* Task App  
  * Cute anime girl thats jumps and does cute poses  
  * AI voice (audio)  
  * Take a selfie with the anime girl  
  * Sends reminders/notifications (push notifications)  
* Vacation Planner  
  * Incorporate map, location, real time, AI api  
  * All resources in one place (no need to jump from site to site)  
  * Helpful for indecisive people (i.e. able to provide concrete ideas) and can adjust vacation plans (romantic getaway vs. family vacation)  
  * Collaborative planning (multiple people can join in and plan the vacation)  
  * Budget friendly location, hidden gems  
  * Calculating the expenses throughout trips (can put in all who paid, who ate/used, and automatically calculate everything)   
  * Simplified version would include shared features and main itinerary for the app  
    * 2-3 tabs: itinerary, map (where your going to go), calendar
